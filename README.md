# Admin-Dashboard

Completed Through The Odin Project

cedrus32.github.io/admin-dashboard/

The original goal of this project was to find a balance between CSS flex and grid properties to create a responsive layout. My biggest challenge during the initial build-out was ensuring element padding, margins, and positioning remained consistent and workable across media queries.

As I added more features to the project, I discovered issues with the original document structure and styling. To address this, I modified parts of the HTML structure and built out the JavaScript and CSS to capture and apply desired the styling rules.

I changed several design elements as the project came together, and I found myself increasingly focused on transition/transform accessibility. The project currently accounts for users who have "reduced motion" preferred on their device, minimizing motion by default and only including motion-rich features if that setting is NOT preferred by the user.
